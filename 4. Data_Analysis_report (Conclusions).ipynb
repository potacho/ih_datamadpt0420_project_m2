    "- **Cut** is determined by how a diamond’s facets interact with light. It is influenced by three factors:\n",
    "    - Precision of cut: How the size and angles relate to the different parts of the stone\n",
    "    - Symmetry: How precisely the various facets of a diamond align and intersect\n",
    "    - Polish: The details and placement of the facet shapes as well as the outside finish of the diamond\n",
    "    \n",
    "    According to those parameters, the Gemological Institue of America ([GIA](https://4cs.gia.edu/en-us/diamond-cut/)) labels each diamonds in cut quality increasing order into Poor, Fair, Good, Very Good, and Excellent. In the case of our sample, we are going to consider Premium and Ideal as to levels of excellency, being Ideal the highest one\n",

    "- **Clarity** is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification. A stone is graded as flawless (FL) if, under 10-power magnification, no inclusions (internal flaws) and no blemishes (external imperfections) are visible. Regarding this measure, we could rank diamonds by \n",

    "\n",
    "    - A diamond with a lower depth percentage usually appears larger due to its increased width, but often creates a dark appearance as the diamond doesn’t reflect light as well\n",

    "     - If the table percentage is too high, light doesn’t reflect off of the diamond’s crown angles and facets leaving the diamond looking dull. \n",

    "## Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Our primarely exploratory analysis raised our awareness of\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The small data structure we were managing**, as it did have volume - over 40k entries - but not variety - only 10 data attributes - and variability, as the data was static, integrated and consistent\n",
    "- **The data cleaning needs**, as there were measures taking 0 as a value\n",

    "- **Price-color/clarity correlation was relevant** as they were responsible for the price-carat relation distortion. In other words, those diamonds with low carat but high price owe its valuation to either its top color or high clarity quality\n",
    "- **Price-cut correlation was negligible**. Price slightly increases whenever the cut quality does, however, this trend it broken in extreme cut classes - poor and excellent \n",
    "- **Price-depth/table correlation was irrelevant** as depth and table have no price influence\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Diamonds shapes were present in the data**. For that sake, we relied on diamonds.pro guides on diamonds proportions. Whereas, we found out that price is higher for fancy shapes than for traditional ones. Moreover, fancy diamonds are the most numerous in our sample. Consequently, fancy-shaped diamonds should be at the center of the commercial strategy of these diamonds\n",
    "- **Potential Clients could be willing to buy this diamonds**, making clear which ones are our priority\n",
    "    - #1 Tiffany & Co for the potential amount sold at a profitable level\n",
    "    - #2 Other brands, as these group has diamonds with potential to be sold at a high price making up de greatest part of the diamonds sample\n",
    "    - #3 Cartier and Harry Winston as these are the thrid most profitable and the ones who could make our dimons more exclusive and appreciatted, despite not being the most relevant ones in terms of quantity\n",
    "    - #4 Piaget, as without making an offer in first place to Cartier and Harry Winston we can not define the strategy for Piaget, who would be our second option for selling the top quality diamonds not accepted by the other clients\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Ranking could fit better to this sample regarding the quality of the diamonds**. We observe that diamonds do not always have the price their quality suggest, for that purpose, we make a quality and a price ranking, which do not match at the moment. As a result, a valuation process should be stablished\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We started with 10 columns but finished with 18. We managed to shed light on how price was constructed in relation with the rest of the diamonds qualities. Furthermore, we enriched the dataset in order to point out to potencial clients that could be interested in these diamonds, and also, we defined the shapes of the diamonds portfolio we have to manage with the aim of constructing a solid commercial strategy. \n",
