# **Ironhack Visualization Module Project**


## **Data:**

The raw dataset can be downloaded [here](http://www.potacho.com/files/ironhack/diamonds_train.csv) and the processed dataset could be found [here] (diamonds_result.csv).

## **Summary:**

Insightful code and dashboard to learn more about your diamonds dataset and how to use it in real life

Let's learn more about this project!

## **Description:**

The code developed throughout the four notebooks cleans (*Data Exploration*), enriches (*Data Manipulation*), an sheds light through graphs on how diamonds are priced regarding diamonds' 4Cs, their measures and volume (*Price-Variables relation*) and how each should be commercialized according to these characteristics (*Conclusions*). As the foregoing attributes are the most basic information given from any existing diamond, it will be useful to any user that wants to understand better the quality and price approppriateness of the diamonds dataset he/she is managing.

The dashboard helps to directly play with and visualized the processed data.

## How is it different?

This project does not have a mere academic approach, but goes beyond that challenge trying to connect it with a practical use, be it the presumption that we want to commercialize these diamonds.

## ToDo

As next steps, it will be interesting to further enrich basic diamonds dataset in order to make this code magic engine that can tell you practical information about your diamonds departing from very simple raw data.
