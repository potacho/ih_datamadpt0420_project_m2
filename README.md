## **Data:**

Dataset can be downloaded [here](http://www.potacho.com/files/ironhack/diamonds_train.csv). 

---

## **Deliverables:**

A GitHub repository, preferably named: **ih_datamadpt0420_project_m2**, including:

- `data_analysis_report.ipynb` file that holds the results of challenge 1. You may add to the `notebooks/` folder any work/draft notebooks, data or files used to build your report.

- `README.md` file explaining the job done, your main conclusions and the **link** to your Tableau Public dashboard. You may find more info of how to build a README file [here](https://github.com/potacho/data-project-template/blob/master/README.md).

### **Presentation:**

- **Time:** 2 minutes sharp.
- **Content:** explain why your dashboard funtionalities are the best for getting meaningful data insights. Support your arguments in the conclusions obtained from the exploratory analysis. Conclude your pitch telling us (in one sentence) the most important insight (under your criteria) you've extracted.
- **You only need your Dashboard (no Jupyter, no PowerPoint, no nothing!!!)**

## **Challenge 1: Exploratory Data Visualization Charts and Summary Statistics**

The goal of this challenge is to build an **exploratory data analysis report** in order to gain initial insight on our diamonds dataset. Your notebook must include:

- Summary statistics including descriptive statistics (max, min, mean, standard deviation, percentiles, correlations, etc.) and data types (integer, float, boolean, string, etc.).
- Data visualizations charts in order to capture a large amount of data all at once in a clear and concise manner (Box Plots, Histograms, Bar Plots, Scatter Plots, Correlation Matrix, etc.).

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** You may use the tools explained during lessons that you find more convenient in order to provide the requested output. 


### **Bonus: Hypothesis Testing**

Bonus info will be provided soon.

## **Challenge 2: Tableau Data Dashboard**

Dashboards are powerful tools for communicating important information **at-a-glance**. The goal of this challenge is to build a data dashboard using our diamonds dataset that will help the final user (i.e.: yourself) to perform better during Module 3 project (Kaggle Competition).

A data dashboard is not exactly a sequential set of descriptive charts like those you have built in challenge 1. Instead, a data dashboard should be **a single interactive interface built around a specific objetive and which components are logically arranged in order to provide data relevant insights effectively**. Therefore, bear in mind the main objective of the competition: _understand the relationship between diamonds attributes (features) or group of attributes, and its price_.
